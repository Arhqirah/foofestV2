deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) and 
[Supabase](https://supabase.com) for custom additions related to forms and whatnot with [Glitch](https://glitch.com) as the main place
we handle our data.
